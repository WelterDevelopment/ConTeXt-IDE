Remark:

This set of files is not for redistribution but for an experiment between
Luigi and Hans regarding a luatex followup. The usage (after making a
format) is:

    context --lmtx ...

or

   \enablelmtx

For sure there will be gliches and some code will be upgraded (like the
img.* related functions). At this moment the test suite compiles without
errors but the output has not been checked in detail. The luatex manual
is one of the other test cases.
